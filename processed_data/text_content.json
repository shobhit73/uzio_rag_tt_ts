Employees clock in/out, record meals and rests, and see their hours in one place, while managers get a clean review flow for daily checks and end-of-period approvals. Everything is designed to be quick for frontline users and auditable for admins, so you reduce corrections and speed up payroll."

You can define meal and rest policies (paid or unpaid), set eligibility thresholds and repeat rules, and choose whether to auto-deduct or simply flag missing breaks for attestation. This gives you the flexibility to match local laws and company policy without forcing a one-size-fits-all rule across teams. When exceptions occur, they\u2019re visible and traceable\u2014so you can correct issues before they reach payroll."

Approved PTO and unpaid time off sync to payroll and, for salaried employees, regular hours adjust automatically when unpaid time is used. If your PTO accrues off hours worked, using UZIO for both Payroll and PTO ensures automatic accrual calculations without manual reconciliation. This end-to-end flow moves you from policy \u2192 request \u2192 approval \u2192 pay with fewer errors."
