    "content": "UZIO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Time Tracking and Scheduling module lets teams capture time exactly where work happens\u00e2\u20ac\u201don the web, in the employer and employee portals, the UZIO mobile app, or a shared time kiosk. Employees clock in and out, record meals and rests, and see their hours in one place, while managers get a clean review flow for daily checks and end-of-period approvals. Everything is designed to be quick for frontline users and auditable for admins, reducing corrections and speeding up payroll.\n\nBreak compliance is built in. You can define paid and unpaid meal and rest policies, set eligibility thresholds and repeat rules, and choose whether to auto-deduct or simply flag missing breaks for attestation. This gives you the flexibility to match local laws and company policies without forcing a one-size-fits-all rule across teams. When exceptions occur, they are visible and traceable so you can correct issues before they reach payroll.\n\nScheduling is just as streamlined. Managers create and publish shifts, make updates, and ensure coverage across locations or roles. Employees see their assigned shifts on web and mobile as soon as schedules are published, helping reduce no-shows and last-minute confusion. Simple controls keep the learning curve low so planners can move quickly even during high-change periods.\n\nManagers can publish open shifts for eligible employees to claim on mobile. Employees can offer their assigned shift to co-workers or request a swap; these actions route to managers for approval or rejection, and once published, updates hit everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calendars. Eligibility rules, such as requiring the same work location, are enforced so coverage changes stay compliant and auditable.\n\nManager workflows tie the whole process together. You can monitor who is on the clock right now, review timesheets for your direct reports, approve or send back changes, and sync hours to payroll when they are final. Because time and schedules live in the same system as HR and payroll, data flows forward with fewer exports, fewer manual edits, and a clear audit trail from shift plan to time worked to payroll. ",

On mobile, time off lives in the bottom navigation so people can request from anywhere without emailing HR.\n\nFor admins, policies and holidays are centralized and configurable. You can add and manage time-off policies, then assign them to employees; holiday calendars are created from the same area so observed holidays flow into balances and availability. This keeps policy rules and holidays consistent across teams and locations.\n\nThe approvals flow is built in. Employees submit requests; managers are notified and can approve or deny with notes. Admin dashboards let you review pending requests at a glance, reducing email back-and-forth and keeping decisions auditable. That visibility cuts down on surprises at payroll time and makes it easy to enforce blackout dates or staffing minimums.\n\nTime Off is wired to payroll and scheduling. Approved PTO and unpaid time off sync to payroll and, for salaried employees, regular hours adjust automatically when unpaid time is used. If your PTO accrues off hours worked, using UZIO for both payroll and PTO ensures automatic accrual calculations without manual reconciliation. This end-to-end flow moves you from policy to request to approval to pay with fewer errors. ",

    "section_title": "Payroll",
    "content": "UZIO Payroll starts with clean setup so every run is predictable. You define pay groups and pay schedules (weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, and so on), pick first pay dates, and make sure your payroll calendar aligns with benefits cut-offs so per-pay-period deductions calculate correctly. Once company and banking details are in place, this foundation prevents most downstream errors and makes reviews faster.\n\nRunning payroll follows a guided flow: load hours and earnings, review taxes and net pay, then approve. You can handle regular payrolls and special or off-cycle runs such as bonuses or corrections, and a recent enhancement lets admins process regular and special payrolls at the same time when timelines are tight. The system also documents how bank holidays impact timing so you can plan approvals and funding with confidence.\n\nAdmins can fine-tune results without breaking auditability. Common tasks include salary proration, overriding deduction or contribution methods, and making targeted employee payroll updates (earnings, deductions, contributions, direct-deposit changes for employees without portal access, and similar actions). These controls help you correct edge cases in the current cycle while keeping the underlying setup stable for future runs.\n\nTaxes and year-end are built into the flow. UZIO documents how tax payments (impounds) are scheduled and debited relative to check dates and due dates, so finance teams can reconcile cash movement. On the employee side, the help center explains the W-2 form and provides guidance for downloading W-2s, with updates noting mobile access as well. For bonuses or gift cards, gross-up tools calculate the necessary tax to land a target net.\n\nAccounting and reporting close the loop. UZIO offers a two-way QuickBooks Online integration with per-component mapping (earnings, employee deductions, employer taxes and contributions) and clear syncing rules such as syncing after approval. Finance users can also build custom payroll reports to analyze costs, taxes, and liabilities over time. Together, these features reduce spreadsheets, keep the ledger in sync, and make audits straightforward. ",

This two-path approach, employer-driven or self-service, keeps momentum up while giving admins full visibility.\n\nOn the hiring side, you can configure offer letters and supplemental documents (handbooks, policies) once and reuse them across roles. If your workflow includes screening, UZIO documents an integration with Checkr for background checks, and for work authorization there is a built-in integration with Clear I-9 to manage I-9 and E-Verify for onsite or remote hires. These pieces reduce manual steps and keep sensitive compliance tasks inside one flow.\n\nThe Documents area acts as your onboarding content library. Admins can add custom employee documents, organize them with custom categories, and point managers to the exact place to upload or assign paperwork from the employer portal.\n\nTasks make the process trackable.

You can load plans and rates (medical, dental, vision, and others), define eligibility classes by role or location, and set contribution strategies such as fixed dollar amounts, percentages, and dependent tiers. A decision support system helps compare plan designs so you can present the right mix by cost and coverage before publishing packages.\n\nEnrollment is built for real life. Admins can run new-hire enrollments, open enrollment, and mid-year enrollments when adding clients or moving groups mid-cycle. The enrollments dashboard shows participation and completion status and lets you monitor progress.\n\nRenewals are streamlined. At plan year change you can roll over coverage and select replacement plans where necessary, then monitor the impact through enrollment and financial dashboards for cost visibility. On the employee side, help articles confirm that workers enroll from the portal and can access their elections and premiums at any time; mobile FAQs reinforce that eligibility and enrollment happen through the employee portal.\n\nFinally, benefits data does not live in a silo.

    "section_title": "Open Shift",
    "content": "An Open Shift is a shift that is not assigned to any specific employee and is available for eligible employees to claim. Open shifts are created against one or more work locations, and any active employee belonging to those locations can view and request them. Once a claim is approved, the shift is assigned to that employee and behaves like a regular shift for time tracking and approval.\n\nTo create an Open Shift, employer users use the same Add Shift workflow on the scheduler grid. They can either double-click a cell or click the plus (+) icon in the grid to open the shift creation window. In the Assignee dropdown, they select 'Open Shift' (instead of a specific employee) and then choose one or more work locations. If multiple locations are selected, the system creates one open shift per location so people at those locations can see and claim them.\n\nEmployees can only claim open shifts from the mobile app. From the Schedule tab, they go to Open Shifts \u2192 Available Shifts to see all unassigned shifts available for their work locations. They tap the Claim link on a shift they want; this creates a claim request that is sent to the admin for review. Until the admin approves, the shift remains unassigned and stays in a pending status.\n\nEmployees can also manage their pending claims from Open Shifts \u2192 Requested Shifts in the mobile app. There they see all open shifts they have claimed that are still waiting for approval and can cancel a claim via a three-dot menu \u2192 'Cancel Request.' Cancelling removes their claim and makes the shift available again to other eligible employees.\n\nAdmins review and decide on open shift claims directly from the scheduler. Clicking the shift and choosing the Claims action opens a list of employees who have requested that open shift. The admin can accept or reject each request. When they accept one employee's claim, the system automatically rejects all other pending requests for that shift, assigns the shift to the accepted employee, and notifies everyone involved with appropriate emails and/or push messages (e.g., an email confirming approval with shift location, time, and date).

    "content": "A Shift Swap allows two employees to exchange their assigned shifts, subject to eligibility rules and manager approval. The main constraint is that employees can only swap shifts with coworkers who belong to the same work location. This ensures coverage and compliance remain intact while still giving employees flexibility to handle personal conflicts or preferences.\n\nEmployees initiate a swap from the UZIO mobile app (this is not available on web). They open the Schedule tab, go to My Shifts, and use the Swap link on the shift they want to exchange. This opens a window showing shifts of other employees at the same location. The requesting employee selects one or more target shifts and then taps the Swap Shift button, sending swap requests to the selected coworkers.\n\nThe coworkers receive notifications via email and push, including details of both parties' shifts (times, dates, and any comments). Each recipient reviews the request in the mobile app under Schedule \u2192 Shift Requests \u2192 Swap \u2192 Incoming Requests, and can Accept or Reject it. If they accept, the requester is notified that the swap is now pending manager approval; if they reject, the requester is notified that the swap was declined.\n\nEmployees can manage their own outgoing swap requests under Schedule \u2192 Shift Requests \u2192 Swap \u2192 'Your Requests'. From there, they can cancel any pending swap request, which keeps the original schedule unchanged. After an employee has accepted a swap request from someone else, they can still change their mind and cancel that accepted request via the Incoming Requests view; this triggers a notification back to the requester.\n\nAdmins finalize shift swaps from the scheduler in the employer portal. Using the Needs Approval icon, they open Shift Swap Requests to see pending swaps, including both employees and their shift details. The admin can Accept or Reject each request. Shifts are not actually exchanged until the admin approves. Once a decision is made, both employees are notified, and on approval their schedules are automatically updated.

Unlike a swap, where two employees directly exchange shifts, a shift offer is more like giving away a shift to someone who currently has no shift at that time.\n\nEmployees initiate an offer from the mobile app only. From Schedule \u2192 My Shifts, they choose a shift and tap the Offer link. A window appears listing coworkers from the same work location who are eligible to take the shift (i.e., those who do not already have a conflicting shift). The employee selects one or more coworkers and taps Offer Shift to send requests.\n\nSelected coworkers receive email and push notifications with details about the offered shift, and they manage responses via Schedule \u2192 Shift Requests \u2192 Offer \u2192 Incoming Requests. Each coworker can Accept or Reject the offer. Accepting an offer sends a confirmation to the original requester and notifies the admin that a shift offer is pending approval; rejecting sends a different notification to the requester saying their offer was declined.\n\nEmployees who initiate offers can manage their outgoing requests under Schedule \u2192 Shift Requests \u2192 Offer \u2192 'Your Requests'. For each pending offer, they can open the three-dot menu and select Cancel Request; cancelling keeps their original shift assignment intact.\n\nThe admin\u2019s role mirrors the swap flow: they review pending offer requests from the scheduler using Needs Approval \u2192 Shift Offer Requests. Admins can approve or reject each offer. On approval, the system updates schedules so the offered shift moves from the original employee\u2019s schedule to the accepting coworker\u2019s schedule.

The system supports different notification types for employees and managers that can be configured in the Schedule Settings.\n\nFor employees, notifications include:\n- Reminders to start shift on time: A reminder is sent shortly before the scheduled start time to prompt the employee to clock in. A sample push notification message might say that a shift from 09:00 AM\u201306:00 PM is about to start and list the employee\u2019s name.\n- Reminders to end shift on time: A similar reminder is sent near the scheduled end time, encouraging the employee to clock out.\n- Notification of shift publish: When a manager publishes shifts, employees receive notifications informing them that new or updated shifts are available to view.\n- Alerts for early or late shift start and early or late shift end: If an employee starts or ends outside the configured threshold around the schedule, the system sends an alert. This helps employees quickly understand when they are off their planned schedule.\n- No show alerts: If an employee does not clock in at all by a certain time relative to the shift start, a no-show alert can be sent, often summarizing missing employees by name and shift.\n\nFor managers, similar notification types exist with a managerial perspective:\n- Alerts when employees do not start or end their shift on time (within configured thresholds).\n- Alerts for early or late starts and ends across the team, so supervisors can see deviations from schedule.\n- No show alerts summarizing employees who failed to clock in for a given shift window.\n\nThese notifications can be sent in multiple channels (email, push, and SMS). Sample templates include a subject line (e.g., 'Alert: Few employees have missed their shift 09:00 AM - 06:00 PM'), a body listing affected employees, and a link directing managers to log in and review schedules.

    "content": "Schedule Settings give admins fine-grained control over how scheduling interacts with time tracking, especially around clock-in/clock-out behavior and default shift patterns. These settings are managed from the employer portal under Time Tracking Settings \u2192 Schedule.\n\nKey settings include:\n- Prevent Early Clock In: When enabled, employees are blocked from clocking in earlier than a configured threshold before their scheduled shift start time. For example, with a 15-minute threshold and a 9:00 AM start, employees cannot clock in before 8:45 AM for that shift. This helps control unplanned overtime. The restriction applies only to scheduled shifts; if an employee clocks in under 'Unscheduled,' this guardrail does not apply, allowing flexibility when someone works outside their schedule.\n- Mark Late Clock In: This flag automatically marks a time entry as 'Late' when an employee clocks in after a defined threshold from the scheduled start time (e.g., after 9:15 AM for a 9:00 AM shift with a 15-minute window). This supports punctuality tracking and reporting.\n- Default Shift Timings: Admins can define default shift start and end times (e.g., 9:00 AM\u20135:00 PM). These defaults pre-populate when creating new shifts, speeding up schedule creation while still allowing users to override for specific cases.\n\nEmployee Experience of Schedule on Web: Employees log into the UZIO employee portal and navigate to Time Tracking \u2192 Schedule. The page displays their assigned shifts, timings, and related details for the selected period. They can switch views between day, week, and month to see their schedule at different granularities.\n\nEmployee Experience of Schedule on Mobile: In the UZIO mobile app, employees tap the Schedule tab in the bottom navigation. The view is split into:\n- My Shifts: Shows assigned shifts by day and supports actions such as Swap and Offer where enabled.\n- Open Shifts: Contains Available Shifts (unassigned shifts at the employee\u2019s work location that can be claimed) and Requested Shifts (open shifts the employee has already claimed and that are pending approval).\n- Shift Requests: Centralizes both Swap and Offer workflows with two sub-sections each:\n  - Swap: Incoming Requests (others asking to swap with you) and Your Requests (swaps you have initiated).\n  - Offer: Incoming Requests (shifts offered to you) and Your Requests (offers you have sent).\n\nThis configuration plus the web and mobile views gives employees full transparency into their schedule and related actions, while admins maintain control over how closely actual time tracking must follow the plan.

Instead of paying overtime off a single base rate, you must compute a weighted average of all the employee\u2019s straight-time earnings and hours. For example, imagine an employee works 30 hours as a Driver at $10/hour and 20 hours as a Cleaner at $20/hour in a week where 5 of those hours are overtime. First you calculate total straight-time wages: (30 \u00d7 $10) + (20 \u00d7 $20) = $700. Then you divide by total hours worked (50) to get a blended regular rate of $14/hour. The overtime premium is half of that blended rate ($7), so the blended overtime rate for each job is the job\u2019s base rate plus $7 (e.g., Driver OT = $17, Cleaner OT = $27), and similarly, blended double time uses twice the blended regular rate added to each job\u2019s base.

After timesheets are approved for a pay period, an employer user with payroll access can open the payroll run and use an option such as Sync Time or Import Hours from Time Tracking. The system fetches all approved hours and premiums (regular, overtime, double overtime, break premiums, and other earnings mapped to specific earning codes) and populates the payroll input grid. Only approved entries are included; pending or unapproved changes remain excluded to protect payroll accuracy. The section also explains that if timesheets are edited after a sync, the user may need to re-sync or manually adjust payroll, depending on configuration. Mapping between time categories (regular, OT, DOT, premiums) and payroll earning codes is maintained at the configuration level, ensuring consistent postings to each pay item. The sync process helps eliminate duplicate data entry and reduces payroll errors.",

In the example, an employee named David works 30 hours as a Driver at $10/hour and 20 hours as a Cleaner at $20/hour, for a total of 50 hours, including 5 overtime hours. Step 1 is to calculate total straight-time wages by multiplying hours for each job by its rate and summing the results: (30 \u00d7 $10) + (20 \u00d7 $20) = $700. Step 2 is to divide the total straight-time wages by total hours worked (regular + OT + DOT) to get the blended regular rate: $700 \u00f7 50 = $14/hour. Step 3 is to calculate the overtime premium: the additional half-time amount is half of the blended rate ($7). Each job\u2019s blended overtime rate becomes its base hourly rate plus $7 (for example, Driver OT = $17/hour, Cleaner OT = $27/hour). The same idea applies for double time, using twice the blended regular rate to determine the double-time premium added to each base rate. UZIO uses this approach to properly allocate overtime and double-time wages across all jobs worked in the week.",
